Aim: Acquisition of cell phone and mobile devices.
1. To get information from an Android device is easy.

2. Go on menu Settings>>About Phone>>Software and Hardware information

3. You will get the information like firmware version, baseband version, 
and kernel version, build number, software number, browser version etc.
In this case, we use a Host Windows and Android Software Development Kit.
 The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) helps developers build, test,
 and debug applications to run on Android. It includes software libraries, APIs,
 emulator, reference material, and many other tools. These tools not only help create Android applications
 but also provide documentation and utilities that help significantly in forensic analysis of Android devices.
Having sound knowledge of the Android SDK can help you understand the particulars of a device. This, in turn, 
will help you during an investigation. During forensic examination, the SDK helps us connect the device and
 access the data present on the device.

The method to get the serial number of an Android device is the following:

1. Step one: Download from web site the SDK package:
https://developer.android.com/sdk/download.html?v=archives/android-sdk-windows-
1.6_rl.zip

2. Step two: Create a folder called ANDROIDSDK and unzip the zip file you downloaded.

3. Step three: Connect your Android device via USB cable.

4. Step four: In the command prompt Windows, browse on the ANDROIDSDK folder tools and we run adb device command.

5. Step five: If all work properly, a list of linked devices will appear with a serial number, if not present on devices list, check that the proper work of the drive and USB debugging enabled.

C:\cd androidsdk
C:\androidsdk>cd tools
C:\androidsdk>tools adb devices
It will display the list of devices attached.
